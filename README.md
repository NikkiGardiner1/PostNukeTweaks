# Notice
This is outdated and I'm hitting alot of roadblocks while updating it (Mostly pertaining to room lights, radiation is fine) and may need to wait for a more stable exiled 8 release
# PostNukeTweaks
Small Exiled 7 plugin that does things after the Warhead detonates

- Turn's lights back to normal (or to custom colour)
- Highly configurable radiation on surface
